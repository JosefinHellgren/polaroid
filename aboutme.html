        I’m a 36 year old app developer student from the northern parts of Sweden.
        <br>
        I´m on to my second year as an app developer student and have recently returned from my internship at Bontouch
        where i worked on a internal project building an app from scratch and also working with a agile team with an app
        in production. I enjoy working in a team and have played teamsports my whole life.
        I’m a high energy and engaged person that dives deep into projects.
        I have always had many side projects in life, producing podcasts, maintaining a small e-commerce site and hiked
        alot.

        <br>
        As a programmer I am curious, very engaged and seeks many springs to find a solution to challenges I stumble
        upon.

        In school we learned to build apps with languages as Kotlin, Swift with Ui-kit and SwiftUI, Javascript with html
        and
        Css, React.js and are now learning Flutter with Dart.
        On my spare time I try to come up with new projects to play around with to make the best of my learning.
